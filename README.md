# Module 4 Challenge - Pandas

## Part 1 - Explore the Data
The code in this section helps understand the structure of the data as it was provided. It looks to understand the structure 
and get a few basic facts from the raw data.

## Part 2 - Transform the Data
This section creates new data by adding columns that incorporate formulas. There are some conditional values. The new columns
allow for a better understanding of what the data means for the business. It allows for easier understanding of complex values. 

## Part 3 - Confirm your work
This section allows a way to confirm all of section 2 formulas are correct by having a comparison. To have the correct answer 
each formula would have to build off each other perfectly. 

## Part 4 - Summarize and Analyze
Part 4 is rearranging the data and manipulating it to creat results that allow the end audience to understand the data as a 
whole. It looks for collective answers. Below is a summary of an analysis from the data as a whole:
